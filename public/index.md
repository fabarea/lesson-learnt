This is a living document that I am regularly updating when making new findings.

The content is generarted by `mkdocs` with the `material design` theme. In the future, I could have a look at [docz](https://www.docz.site/) which brings the power of [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) support. Let see...

My notes are taking with `Typora` which is a great tool. Although not Open Source, the tool is free. The tool is not perfect though. For instance, I am missing the [space indentation](https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/579) options. Visual Studio could be an option. Still looking for good plugins.
