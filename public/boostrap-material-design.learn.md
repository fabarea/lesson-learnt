# MDB - Material Design Boostrap

## How to get started?

Read the instruction from https://mdbootstrap.com/cli/quick-start/

Check the tab "pro" and continue with that.

* For a TYPO3 project, just install via `npm` (take the pro version) into `EXT:speciality` and create a custom bundle like done for climate-services.ch
* For a new project, go with the CLI (**To be verified ?**)
  Check this page: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/getting-started/quick-start/

In case, there is a video on the "quick start" page to show how to get started. They use the `mdb` to start a new project.

```shell
mdb init
...
```
